# Supervillain Project

My project will be based on a supervillain that I  would like to be recognized 
and it will be a website based on a female villain known as Reeva Payge from Marvel's comic book series The Gifted. 
She is the face of a revolution that wants to destroy X-men mutants that interferes with her plan to destroy the world.

## User Experience
    
- UX Design

This website is for users that are interested in comic book villains. 
They want to see a villain that deserves to be recognized because of his/her interesting character especially 
their purpose to bring destruction to the world. 
My project will help users to see their favorite villains with their 
interesting web platform and it will achieve by creating a fan base for those that love their favorite villains.

### User stories
- As a user, I would like to see my favorite villain that has their own background story including 
his/her abilities and weakness.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate easily so that I can see clearly where I need to go.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the full content of the website.
- As a user, I want to catch up with her updates because I want to know if there are any changes to the website.
- As a villain, I want to have an audience that understands me personally and 
I want the users to get to know me because of my evil plan to destroy X-men mutants
- As a villain, I want to be recognized as one of the greatest because I have proved 
to my audience that I can bring out the best and I'm willing to create a legacy for the next generation villains.
- As a villain, I want the users to see me clearly and understand what my purpose is.

### Design
 - Color Scheme
     -   The main colors I used are purple, light blue and black
- Typography
      -  I used Libre Baskerville to create as a main font with the Serif because it creates an interesting presentation for Reeva Payge. This font is nice and beautiful and it works well as users can get to read on-screen clearly and differently. 
- Imagery
    -  I found the image on the website to find an interesting supervillain and It made me realize that imagery is very important for my website. This image could attract the user's attention.

## Wireframe
This is the wireframe that i did for desktop, mobile and tablet. It shows my explanation on how my website should be.

## Features

The supervillain website will have three navigation menus (About, Bio, Subscribe) with each structured layout. 
 
### Existing Features
- About- it allows the users to read the information on the front page with the image of Reeva Payge as 
the leader of the Inner-Circle

- Bio- it allows the users to read the story of Reeva Payge and how she became the leader. 
Also, the users will read their abilities, skills, and weakness.

- Subscribe- it allows the users to follow her by inputting their name and email address. 
After that, they are subscribed to her website.

## Future Feautures
- As a returning user, I want the website to bring out more features such as blogs, 
gallery or even news updates to see what is going with the villain in the future
- As a returning user, I want the website to have major updates especially when I receive the email from the developer.

I even used DevTools to check how my website is doing and to see if there are any bugs. 
So far the website has no bugs and no errors.
