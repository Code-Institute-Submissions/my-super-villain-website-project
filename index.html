      <h1>Reeva Payge</h1>
      <h3>The most dangerous leader of the Inner Circle!</h3>
      <p>"A smart, charming, authoritative, elegant, beautiful woman who is ruthless in her efforts to fight for her people.
         She leads an elite band of followers and has a soft spot for her new recruits but is still capable of extreme violence 
         in defense of her vision."
      </p>
      <p>Reeva was once an open hearted woman, willing to make peace with humans moving into her Chicago neighbourhood 
         and was against her friend Benizerâ€™s plan of having them push out the humans trying to move into their Mutant district. 
         However that all changed when Benizer was killed in front of her by Purifiers. The pain of seeing 
         her only real friend die hardened Reeva, she became ruthless and determined, developing a strong hatred for anyone 
         who doesn't carry an X-Gene. 
         Reeva is a staunch believer in the ways of the Hellfire Club, writing off the X-Men's goal of co-existing with 
         humans as nothing more than a "failed dream". She is also vicious and unforgiving, having demonstrated 
         the will to kill anyone that she perceives as a threat to her own goal, ally and foe alike. 
         She has a somewhat hypocritical nature since she claims to be doing all her actions for the 
         future of her people but will willingly sacrifice as many Mutants as it takes to make her dreams reality.
