        <h1>Life story of Reeva Payge</h1>
        <p>Reeva grew up in the slums of Southside Chicago. She spent most of her life the subject of prejudice, first because of her poverty, then because of the colour of her skin and lastly because she was a mutant. Growing up, Reeva’s only friend was a girl named Benazir, they protected and loved each other. One day, Reeva and Benazir got into a fight and soon after were attacked by a gang of Purifiers. Reeva attempted to summon her powers to defend them but her anger about the fight with Benazir got in the way and her abilities would not come. Benazir was stabbed in the confrontation and all Reeva could do was weep as her friend bled out and died in the street. Eventually, she took certain risks that led to building her wealth and social status until she was able to earn a seat in the Inner Circle. </p>

        <h2>Abilities and Skills</h2>
        <p>Reeva can generate a high note from her vocal cords that directly affects the brain's neuro-chemistry. Her sonic scream is capable of scrambling brains. The frequency she creates appears to be capable of blocking other mutants’ powers. She Reeva can also direct her powers towards certain people while leaving others unaffected, allowing her to incapacitate enemies without effecting her allies even if they are in close proximity. It is said she can make her victims feel like they’re in the process of dying and her powers are lethal. Reeva activates her abilities by inhaling through her nose, then releasing the sound. Though seemingly a whisper, the frequency of the note is beyond an ordinary human's ability to hear.</p>
    <br>
        <h2>Weakness</h2>
        <p>Reeva's sonic scream cannot create a physical barrier, and thus would leave her open to insentient attacks. Also, her powers can backfire when used on mutants who do not have control over their powers. Moreover, some powers are incredibly dangerous when distorted by Reeva.</p>
